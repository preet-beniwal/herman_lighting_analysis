## 📖 Why Analyze Operations in the Lighting Industry?

I created this project to tackle the multifaceted challenges of a hardware-focused, design-driven business. The lighting sector requires balancing artistic vision with engineering rigor, durable manufacturing with cost management, and complex installation with customer satisfaction.

Through this analysis, I aimed to:
*   **Decode the Value Chain:** Map the complete journey of a lighting fixture, from raw material sourcing and precision manufacturing to global distribution and post-installation service.
*   **Identify Friction Points:** Analyze where quality inconsistencies emerge, where logistics cause delays, and where customer support processes break down.
*   **Design for Resilience:** Propose a robust operational framework that embeds quality at every stage, turning streamlined processes into a competitive advantage and a driver of brand trust.




## 💡 Core Insights & Strategic Value

The analysis concludes that for a company like Herman Lighting, **operational excellence is the foundation of brand integrity**. A perfectly engineered fixture that arrives late, is difficult to install, or fails prematurely erodes customer trust entirely. This project demonstrates how to build a resilient, quality-centric operational system that not only prevents problems but also becomes a key market differentiator.
